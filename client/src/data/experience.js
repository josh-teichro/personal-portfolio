          16 month co-op working on vehicle software features, in C++, with some Matlab. Work was computer vision intensive and required knowledge of low level image processing algorithms, as well as high level software development techniques.

          <li> fixing bugs in current projects </li>
          <li> converting common computer vision algorithms into C++ code </li>
          <li> researching and developing new solutions for existing projects </li>
          <li> maintaining project codebases </li>
          <li> training new interns to understand existing projects </li>
         </ul>
        <p>
          As an intern at Magna, I began my term working on smaller tasks such as writing tools and testing existing features, however, my last 8 months were spent working directly alongside my superior developing new algorithms and writing fresh code. During this time I gained the responsibility of writing an entire project codebase from scratch - a project which would surpass its previous version and put my name on two new patents.
