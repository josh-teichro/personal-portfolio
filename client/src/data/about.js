        Hi there!
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Joshua Teichroeb and I’m a computer scientist. I just graduated from the University of Toronto this last spring (Apr. 2020) where I received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I’m now looking for an opportunity to put all my freshly learned knowledge into practice and maybe even make a mark of my own in the software development industry.

        I’m originally from a small town in southern Manitoba. As a home-schooled kid, I always wanted to be a part of the bigger world. I idolized such figures as Isaac Newton who not only understood the bigger picture but also changed the way that people saw the world. I wanted to be able to create something completely new that nobody had ever seen before so that I too could be a part of what drives this world forward. To make this dream come true I left everything I had my small town in Manitoba to take on the best schooling that I could afford. I moved to Toronto and started studying computer science, and now my new love for programming is my tool with which I will continue to pursue my passion.

        Aside from the boring prologue, I’m also your regular introvert geek. I really do love what I do (i.e. programming), but when I’m not working on school or solo projects, you’ll most likely find me relaxing by watching a particular genre of Japanese animations or gaming out with some friends. I also love art and music, and although I cant draw for anything, I can at least make a reasonable effort at making music, since I took 7 years of private violin lessons as a kid. My favourite genres of music are lofi hip hop and classical piano/violin. I love dogs and still share a special connection with my parents dog back home. I enjoy sports. I dislike (insert any poorly made movie here), and I love ice cream any time of the year.
